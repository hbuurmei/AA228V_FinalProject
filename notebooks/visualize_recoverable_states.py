        # Visualizing recoverable states

        We try to visualize the 4d state space, and construct a set of "recoverable" states.
        Later, we will use this to find states that are in theory recoverable, but our policy doesn't manage to recover them.

        To determine "recoverability", we have learned a value function as a sort of "ground truth". For the value function, we consider a discretized state set

        $$
        s_1 \in [-4.8, 4.8]\\
        s_2 \in [-4.0, 4.0]\\
        s_3 \in [-0.5, 0.5]\\
        s_4 \in [-4.0, 4.0]
        $$

        Using the cartpole environment where reward `r=0` for a successful step and `r=-1` for a terminating (failure) step, we create a value function `V[s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4]`, which we try to visualize below.
        We can then define recoverability as having a value close to zero, i.e. there is an action which will not eventually lead us to failure.

        ## Three value regimes

        We find that the value function has three regimes:

        1. **Immediate termination:** Every action leads to immediate termination. The value is $-5$ because of our discount factor $\gamma=4/5$ and therefore following the Bellman equilibrium $v = \max r + \gamma v$ we have $v = {(1-\gamma)}^{-1} r = -5$.
        2. **Eventual termination:** Here, the states don't terminate immediately, but failure is inevitable, and the value is $\gamma^k \cdot (-5)$ for some number of steps $k$.
        3. **Recovery:** Here we can recover the state and can therefore achieve a value of $0$ (or close to zero, due to Value Iteration convergence).
